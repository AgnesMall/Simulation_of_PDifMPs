Description: This code provides an implementation of the four Piecewise diffusion Markov Process test problems, discussed in the paper:
      Approximate Bayesian computation for stochastic hybrid systems with ergodic behaviour: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11782

In particular, it produces a path for each test problem, if you the R-file TPs_plot_paths. For a detailed description of the code, please consider the respective files
